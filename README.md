# proximity-based-coupons
## Project Description
This project was made to for a case competition to solve the problem statement "Using the dataset, suggest ways to use AI to analyze people's spending habits and offer custom rewards or deals in real time while theyre shopping" in the 2 hour time span, I took the approach to use the location of the user to generate if they are close enough to a location to be alerted they have a coupon avalable to shop at that store.
With my group we used Google Colab to create Python code using the pandas, matplotlib, and pgeocode libraries to analyze and visualize our results.
Challenges arose in the checkproximity function when finding the distance from the store to the user. In the future I would like to use AI to predict user engagement, optimize the geofence radius for better customer targeting and also for anomaly detection in location data.
This project can help facilitate traffic of in person shoppers so that they are tempted when they are by your business to search and go in. Will probably be best paired with an application that offers deals to from large amounts of businesses.
